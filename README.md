# J. Blog (Blogging Platform)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This is a blogging platform where authors can create content under their custom username, then publish publicly with SEO-friendly rendering, while readers can like posts in realtime. Authors can log in using their google account. This project is created by using Next.js and Firebase.

The UI might not be perfect at the moment though it can be improved for better user experience and more user-friendly, this serves as an MVP to test the features.
